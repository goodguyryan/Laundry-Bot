This is a simple telegram bot that I coded to help track the status of Laundry Machines used at the student apartment I live at!
It is coded in Python and uses the python-telegram-bot API.
Functionality:
-Call /start to start the bot
-Inline keyboard so no further commands need to be typed
-Check status of all machines (Time Left/Empty)
-Load function to start the countdown of a specific machine
-Countdown feature that sends a message whenever a machine has finished its cycle
